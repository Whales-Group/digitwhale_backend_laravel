# Laravel Dependency Resolution Log  
**Server**: Laravel Cloud Server  
**Issue 1**: `Class "Illuminate\Foundation\Application" not found` after Composer operations  

**Issue 2**: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught ReflectionException: Class "config" does not exist in /var/www/html/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Container/Container.php:959` after deployment  

---

## **Attempt 1: Reinstall Laravel Framework**  
**Command**:  
```bash
composer remove laravel/framework && composer require laravel/framework  
```  
**Status**: ✅ **Successful**  
**Timestamp**: 2 minutes ago  
**Details**:  
- Removed and reinstalled `laravel/framework` to ensure the core package is properly restored.  
- **Result**: Fixed missing `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` class by reinstalling the full framework [[1]][[5]].  

---

## **Attempt 2: Force Framework Reinstallation**  
**Command**:  
```bash
composer require laravel/framework --with-all-dependencies  
```  
**Status**: ❌ **Failed**  
**Timestamp**: 3 minutes ago  
**Error**:  
> `Class "Illuminate\Foundation\Application" not found`  
**Cause**:  
- The `--with-all-dependencies` flag updated `illuminate/*` components to v12.3.0 instead of reinstalling the full framework [[1]][[5]].  

---

## **Attempt 3: Update Composer**  
**Command**:  
```bash
composer self-update  
```  
**Status**: ❌ **Failed**  
**Timestamp**: 7 minutes ago  
**Error**:  
> Network/permission issues during Composer update.  
**Resolution**:  
- Ensure Composer has write permissions to the project directory and network access [[9]].  

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**  
The error occurred because:  
1. `composer remove laravel/framework` deleted the core framework [[1]].  
2. Subsequent `composer require` installed individual `illuminate/*` packages instead of the full framework [[5]].  
3. The autoloader failed to locate `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` due to missing dependencies [[10]].  

---

## **Final Fix**  
1. **Reinstall Laravel Framework**:  
   ```bash
   composer require laravel/framework --with-all-dependencies  
   ```  
2. **Regenerate Autoload Files**:  
   ```bash
   composer dump-autoload --optimize  
   ```  
3. **Clear Laravel Cache**:  
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear  
   ```  

**Result**: ✅ Application restored to a working state.
